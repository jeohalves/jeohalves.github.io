To evaluate such methods authors often employ publicly available parking lot image datasets. In this study, we surveyed and compared robust publicly available image datasets specifically crafted to test computer vision-based methods for parking lot management approaches and consequently present a systematic and comprehensive review of existing works that employ such datasets. The literature review identified relevant gaps that require further research, such as the requirement of dataset-independent approaches and methods suitable for autonomous detection of position of parking spaces. In addition, we have noticed that several important factors such as the presence of the same cars across consecutive images, have been neglected in most studies, thereby rendering unrealistic assessment protocols. Furthermore, the analysis of the datasets also revealed that certain features that should be present when developing new benchmarks, such as the availability of video sequences and images taken in more diverse conditions, including nighttime and snow, have not been incorporated.","tags":["parking lot","dataset","benchmark","machine learning","image processing"],"title":"A systematic review on computer vision-based parking lot management applied on public datasets","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Although its outstanding potential, development of efficient architectures and modules requires expert knowledge and amount of resource time available. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary-based neural architecture search approach for efficient discovery of convolutional models in a dynamic search space, within only 24 GPU hours. With its efficient search environment and phenotype representation, Gene Expression Programming is adapted for network's cell generation. Despite having limited GPU resource time and broad search space, our proposal achieved similar state-of-the-art to manually-designed convolutional networks and also NAS-generated ones, even beating similar constrained evolutionary-based NAS works. The best cells in different runs achieved stable results, with a mean error of 2.82% in CIFAR-10 dataset (which the best model achieved an error of 2.67%) and 18.83% for CIFAR-100 (best model with 18.16%). For ImageNet in the mobile setting, our best model achieved top-l and top-5 errors of 29.51% and 10.37%, respectively. Although evolutionary-based NAS works were reported to require a considerable amount of GPU time for architecture search, our approach obtained promising results in little time, encouraging further experiments in evolutionary-based NAS, for search and network representation improvements.","tags":["neural architecture search","automl","cnn","deep learning","gene expression programming"],"title":"Optimizing Neural Architecture Search using Limited GPU Time in a Dynamic Search Space: A Gene Expression Programming Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let‚Äôs make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

To aid this, a preprocessing step of segmentation is performed to reduce the area to be analyzed, segmenting the lungs and removing unimportant regions. Generally, complex methods are developed to extract the lung region, also using hand-made feature extractors to enhance segmentation. With the popularity of deep learning techniques and its automated feature learning, we propose a lung segmentation approach using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) combined with fully connected conditional random fields (CRF), employed in many state-of-the-art segmentation works. Aiming to develop a generalized approach, the publicly available datasets from University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG) and VESSEL12 challenge were studied, including many healthy and pathological CT scans for evaluation. Experiments using the dataset individually, its trained model on the other dataset and a combination of both datasets were employed. Dice scores of 98.67%¬±0.94% for the HUG-ILD dataset and 99.19%¬±0.37% for the VESSEL12 dataset were achieved, outperforming works in the former and obtaining similar state-of-the-art results in the latter dataset, showing the capability in using deep learning approaches.","tags":["lung","computed tomography","image segmentation","ilds","deep learning"],"title":"Extracting Lungs from CT Images Using Fully Convolutional Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://jeohalves.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
